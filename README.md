## Learnings

the actual glass css properties are just two!

```css
backdrop-filter: blur(0.1rem);
```

the backdrop-filter blures the background behind an container. It doesnt work everywhere.

```css
background: linear-gradient(to right bottom, hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.5), hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.2));
```

the glass effect comes from the gradient of white and the transparency with rgba or hsla
